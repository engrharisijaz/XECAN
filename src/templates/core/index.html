        <h1>XECAN LDCT AI Predict Interface</h1>
        <p class="text-justify">XECAN LDCT AI Predict interface designed for the Sybil lung screen AI model. This model was collaboratively developed by MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, the Mass General Cancer Center (MGCC), and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Sybil has undergone validation using three independent datasets: a set of 6,282 LDCTs from NLST participants, 8,821 LDCTs from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and 12,280 LDCTs from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH), including individuals with diverse smoking histories, including nonsmokers.</p>

        <p class="text-justify mt-4">The Sybil model aims to predict 1 to 6 years lung cancer risk based on a single LDCT upload, without the need for additional clinical data or radiologist annotations. If you're interested in utilizing XECAN Lung Screen for predicting lung cancer risk, you can begin by uploading your LDCT scan through the provided interface. Sybil is currently not FDA approved and is intended for utilization in testing and research endeavors.</p>
